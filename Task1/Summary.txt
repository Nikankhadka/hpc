This code is a program that performs matrix multiplication using multiple threads.

The first two lines include the standard input/output and standard library headers, and the pthread library header.

The next section includes function prototypes for "find_number_of_rows_and_columns" and "multiply_matrices"

"max_threads_allowed" is a variable that limits the number of input threads to the dimensions of the matrices

"threadCount" is a variable that keeps track of the number of threads being used.

"unit" is a struct that stores an individual matrix element, and "matrix" is a struct that stores the number of rows, columns, and a reference to the matrix elements.

"matrix A, B, C, _C, target" are all variables of type matrix that are used throughout the program. "pthread_mutex_t mutex" is a variable used for thread synchronization.

"thread_counter" is a variable that keeps track of the number of threads that have been created.

"create_matrix" is a function that creates a matrix with a specified number of rows and columns, and initializes all elements to 0.

"writeinFile" is a function that writes the result of the matrix multiplication to a file named "2059784_MatrixOutput.txt"

"display_matrix" is a function that displays the matrix on the console.

"calculate_one_matrix_unit" is a function that calculates the value of one element in the resulting matrix.

"multiply_matrices" is a function that is executed by each thread and is responsible for performing the matrix multiplication. It uses a mutex to synchronize access to shared data and continues to execute until all elements of the resulting matrix have been calculated.
